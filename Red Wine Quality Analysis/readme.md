Welcome to the Red Wine Quality Analysis project! üç∑ In this analysis, we delve into understanding the quality of red wines by building LightGBM and XGBoost classifier models. The achieved accuracies provide valuable insights into the predictive capabilities of these models.

## Overview

This project aims to assess the quality of red wines through the application of machine learning classifiers, specifically LightGBM and XGBoost. The results obtained provide an understanding of the predictive accuracy of these models in determining the quality of red wines.

## Analysis Results

- **LightGBM Classifier:**
  - Achieved an accuracy of 62% in predicting red wine quality.

- **XGBoost Classifier:**
  - Achieved an accuracy of 60.60% in predicting red wine quality.

These accuracy metrics signify the models' ability to classify and predict the quality of red wines based on the provided features.

## Coding Environment

- **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - Explore the code and analysis using Jupyter Notebook (file: `red_wine_quality_analysis.ipynb`).

- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code):**
  - Additional coding and development can be performed using VS Code.

## Folder Contents

- **Wine Images:**
  - Reference images (`wine_1.jpg`, `wine_2.jpg`, ...) for future project upgrades.

## How to Use

1. Open the Jupyter notebook (`red_wine_quality_analysis.ipynb`) to explore the code and detailed analysis.
2. Access the dataset (`red_wine_dataset.csv`) for an in-depth look at the raw data.
3. Refer to the wine images in the folder for additional context.
