Welcome to the Cereal Analysis project folder! ðŸ¥£ This section delves into predicting cereal ratings through regression analysis. The insights gained from our exploration shed light on factors influencing consumer preferences and guide the development of a machine learning model.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict cereal ratings based on various features. Our regression plot analysis reveals a positive correlation between lower fat content and higher cereal ratings. This observation suggests that consumers may favor cereals with lower fat content in their purchasing decisions.

## Insights

- **Regression Plot Analysis:**
  - Positive correlation observed between lower fat content and higher cereal ratings.
  - Consumers may prioritize cereals with lower fat content.

- **Random Forest Regressor:**
  - Utilized to gain insights into influential features for predicting ratings.
  - Bar chart highlights sugars and calories as pivotal factors in forecasting ratings.

## Feature Engineering

Based on the insights gathered, sugars and calories emerge as crucial variables for predicting cereal ratings. As we prepare for feature engineering, Feature Selection becomes the first step in refining our data.
