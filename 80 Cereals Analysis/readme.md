Welcome to the Cereal Rating Prediction project! ðŸ¥£ In this analysis, we employ a Random Forest Regressor to predict cereal ratings. The insights gained guide us in understanding which features play a crucial role in forecasting consumer ratings.

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting cereal ratings through the application of machine learning, specifically using a Random Forest Regressor. By leveraging this powerful algorithm, we aim to unravel the key features that significantly impact consumer preferences and influence the ratings.

## Insights

**Random Forest Regressor Analysis:**
- Valuable insights into features influencing consumer ratings.
- Sugars and calories identified as pivotal factors in forecasting ratings.
- These insights suggest that sugars and calories are strong candidates for predictor variables in a machine learning model.

## Feature Engineering

Given the importance of sugars and calories, we prepare our data for the first step of Feature Engineeringâ€”Feature Selection. This step ensures that our machine learning model is trained on the most influential and relevant features, enhancing its predictive capabilities.

## Coding Environment

- **Jupyter Notebook:**
  - Explore the code and analysis using Jupyter Notebook (file: `cereal_rating_prediction.ipynb`).
